        Lightweight, user-space execution units akin to Golang's goroutines, enabling highly concurrent operations with minimal overhead.

- **‚è∞ Cron (Job Scheduling)**
    - **Scheduler**
        A powerful and flexible job scheduler for executing tasks at specified intervals or times.
    - **Timepoint Management**
        Define precise execution times and recurring schedules for automated processes.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Environment and Configuration**
    - **Dot File Environment I/O**
        Seamlessly read and write configuration from and to dot files, a common Linux convention.
    - **JSON Handling**
        Robust parsing, building, and manipulation of JSON data for configuration, API communication, and data storage.

- **üåê Web and Networking Utilities**
    - **Robots.txt I/O and Generation**
        Easily manage and generate robots.txt files for web crawler control.
    - **URL Parser, Builder, and Generator**
        Comprehensive utilities for handling URLs, including parsing components, building new URLs, and generating valid URL strings.
    - **Weblet (Web Server)**
    A lightweight and efficient web server component, providing the foundation for building web services and APIs directly within your Netlet application.

        A collection of general-purpose validation functions for common data types.

- **üîß System Utilities**
    - **Cache Management System**
        Efficiently manage in-memory caches to improve application performance.
    - **MIME Type Detection Function**
        Accurately detect MIME types of files based on their content or extension.
    - **Timestamps**
        Utilities for precise timestamp generation and manipulation.

- **üö¶ Finite State Machine (FSM) Management**
    - **Transitions**
        Define and manage state transitions within your application logic.
    - **Callbacks**
        Associate custom functions with state entries, exits, and transitions, enabling powerful event-driven architectures.
